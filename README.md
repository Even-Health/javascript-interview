# Even Health - JavaScript Developer Take Home Assignment (Movie Data)

Welcome to the Even Health JavaScript developer assignment. 
This will be used to establish a baseline for your technical interview.
Feel free to showboat, but whatever you write should work.

## Background
Create a web application that can query and aggregate data from [The Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/).
You will need to create an account to procure an API Key. Query the [popular movies API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-popular-movies) 
for movies that were released in the US and display the following aggregations:
* Average votes by genre.
* Mean popularity by genre
* Use the first letter of each title to count how many times each letter in the alphabet occurs

You may display the data in a table or chart.
The API is paginated, so see if you can get all the data

## Requirements
* Please create a detailed README.md that explains how to run the application
* Use either the React or Vue framework to build the UI
* Ensure the application is unit tested
* Data aggregation needs to be done using JavaScript

## Submission
Please submit your file(s) via email, or a dropbox file. 
Please do not post your solution publicly or on your GitHub page.
